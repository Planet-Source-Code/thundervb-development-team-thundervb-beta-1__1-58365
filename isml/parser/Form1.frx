;hrere we merge 3 lists..
%#RegAll
?#Reg8
?#Reg16
?#Reg32

;$ : we declare asm intructions
;! means popup list , ~ means tooltip ,* means both
;eg 

$! @"mov" [#Reg32,#$] @"," [#RegAll,##,#$,#&]

;asm keyword can be overloaded as long as they do not 
;share something on the first par

$!@"mov" [#Reg8] @"," [#Reg8,##,#$,#&]
$!@"mov" [#Reg16] @"," [#Reg8,#Reg16,##,#$,#&]

$!@"mov" @"dword_ptr_" [#$] @"," [#Reg8,##,#$,#&]

;Rules to folow
;the text is case sensitive by defalt
;the _ means space...
;more spaces are made one (eg dword       ptr myvar -> 
;dword ptr myvar)
;to deine case non sesitive text use @<nocase>
;eg
$!@"mov" @<nocase>"dword_ptr_" [#$] @"," [#Reg8,##,#$,#&]

;now ,  this will match this:
;
;myvar dd 0
;
;mov dword ptr myvar,100
;
