Hi,
look at the panel Settings and if you want to add/remove some item/s let me know
some items are same as in VBINLENEASM settings

I will write all code to save/load settings so do not waste time with it
all that you will need will be avaible via functions Get_<tab name>.
This functions will be in modPublic.bas module.

At first write the version that will work on 100% - inline asm, exported functions...
Then we will add panel Settings.

now look at the Setting Form

Tab Generel
-Load On StartUp - will load add-in on start-up
-UnLoad if Project.... - unload add-in if the new Project is not Standart EXE app

-popup exports... - when user will compile source, show window where can user mark
 exported functions, change base address
 
 note : what about leting user to change name of DLL entry-point? 

-set topmost - like vbinlineasm

-listings... - like vbinlineasm
-save ...    - like vbinlineasm

- compile asm code - compile asm code :-)
- hook compiler    - hook compler

Tab Paths
-no comment

Tab Packer
-no comment

Tab Code colors
-will be upgraded when you will finish the coloring code

Tab Debug
like vbinlineasm

-Tab Compile
like vbinlineasm

StdCall DLL
note - preloader = our asm code to do initializing

-use preloader - use asm code to do initializing
-debug preloader code - will add "int 3" to preloader code -> user could debug asm code in debugger (eg w32dasm)
-patch preloader code - we look for VB5! to locate the VB structure (needed by ThunRTMain)
 maybe exist better way - what about scanning .obj or .lst to locate it? and patch asm code
 
 push <pointer>   - patch this
 call ThunRTMain
 
-vb runtime partial loading - if the caller is VB app and DLL does not contain forms
 loading msvbvm70.dll is not necessary.
 
 note - another instance of msvbvm60.dll is needed only if DLL contain forms and caller is VB app
 
So if you want to add/remove some settings let me know.
